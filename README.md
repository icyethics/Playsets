# Playsets
 A Balatro Mod that allows you to pick a playset of objects that can spawn during your run

 THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT BUILD. THIS MOD IS NOT YET READY FOR USE, BUT MADE AVAILABLE SO OTHER MOD DEVS CAN CONTRIBUTE CODE OR REQUEST FEATURES

 Planned Features:
 - While in a run, the collection will display only the available cards
 - In-game selection
 - General mod set-output, automatically setting up a pack that includes every single key that can be banned or included by a cardset
